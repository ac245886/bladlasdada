This repository provides a lightweight **HTML/JavaScript loader** designed to run classic Flash-based "Gameria" titles in modern browsers using the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) emulator. 

> **Note:** This project serves as a bridge between historical SWF files hosted on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) and modern web standards.

## 🌐 Quick Start

You can jump straight into the kitchen or run the loader locally:

* **Play Online:** [**Launch Papa Louie's Gameria Loader**](https://ac245886.github.io/bladlasdada/gaems.html)
* **Run Locally:** Download the `gaems.html` file. 
    * *Requirement: An active internet connection is needed to fetch the Ruffle engine and the SWF assets.*

## 🎮 Why This Project?

Since the end-of-life for Adobe Flash Player, a massive era of gaming history became inaccessible. This project aims to fix that by providing:

* **Zero Ads:** A clean, distraction-free environment focused solely on gameplay.
* **Modern Compatibility:** No plugins or legacy browsers required—if your browser is up-to-date, it works.
* **Preservation:** Utilizing Ruffle to ensure these games remain playable for educational and nostalgic purposes.

## 🛠️ How It Works



1.  **The Engine:** The loader injects the **Ruffle JavaScript API** into the page.
2.  **The Source:** It fetches high-quality, verified SWF files directly from the **Internet Archive (Archive.org)**.
3.  **The Experience:** Ruffle emulates the ActionScript environment on the fly, allowing the games to run natively in your browser's `<canvas>` element.
