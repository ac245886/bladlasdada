A simple **HTML/JS loader** for Flash SWF games using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/).  
This repository lets you play classic Flash games directly in modern browsers.

## 🌐 Access the Web Loader

Play the games online using this link:  
[**Papa Louie's Gameria Loader**](https://ac245886.github.io/bladlasdada/gaems.html)

You can also download the `gaems.html` file to run the loader offline, but an internet connection is still required to load the SWF files; otherwise, the page will not function.

## 🎮 Why This Project Exists

Modern browsers no longer support Flash, making it increasingly difficult to play classic SWF games.  

This **all-in-one Gameria loader** was created to:

- Provide a **simple, ad-free HTML solution** for playing games
- Preserve historically significant Flash content
- Make it easier to test and use [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) with old SWFs

In short, this project offers a **safer, easier, and centralized way** to enjoy these classic games.
