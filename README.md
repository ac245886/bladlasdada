# Papa Louie's Gameria Library (Ruffle Web Loader)

This repository contains a simple HTML/JS page that uses **Ruffle** to load and play
SWF files. The SWF files included or referenced here were **obtained from the public
Archive.org archive**, where they were made publicly accessible for preservation and
historical purposes.

## You can access the web loader for the games here: [Papa Louie's Gameria Loader](https://ac245886.github.io/bladlasdada/index.html)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I do **not** own the rights to the original SWF games or their trademarks.
All copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property remain with their
respective owners.

The SWF files included in this repository were sourced from:

- **Archive.org**, a public digital preservation platform  
  (e.g. `https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A"Flipline+Studios"`)

These files were already publicly accessible and available for anyone to
view or download. My intention in mirroring them here is for:

- Software preservation  
- Educational purposes  
- Allowing Ruffle compatibility testing  
- Making it easier to run historically significant Flash content

If the rightful owners of any included SWF file request its removal, I will
promptly comply.

## 📜 Licensing Notes

- I am **not claiming ownership** of the SWF files.
- Their original licenses may not permit redistribution, even if publicly
  hosted on Archive.org.
- The HTML/JS code in this repository (not the SWF files) is my own and
  may be used freely.
